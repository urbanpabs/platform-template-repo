Added maturityLevel field to all practices. Added quality-gates and cycle-time-tracking practices. Updated deterministic-tests definition to emphasize reliable reporting of system status and process for handling unreliable tests. Updated evolutionary-coding definition to emphasize backward-compatible changes over refactoring. Removed all dependencies from deterministic-tests (foundational practice). Removed redundant test-data-management dependencies from integration-testing and performance-testing (inherited via test-environment).",
